# loan-dashboardLoan Calculator Dashboard - Documentation
This document outlines the technical implementation and features of the Loan Calculator Dashboard, a React-based application designed to help users calculate loan EMIs, visualize amortization schedules, and convert EMI amounts into various currencies. The application provides a user-friendly experience with a customizable dark/light mode and responsive design.
1. Loan EMI Calculation using Standard Financial Formulas
The core functionality of the application involves calculating the Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) using the standard financial formula:
E = P \times \frac{r \times (1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}
Where:
 * E = EMI (Equated Monthly Installment)
 * P = Principal Loan Amount
 * r = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Interest Rate / 12 / 100)
 * n = Number of Loan Tenor Months
Implementation Details:
 * The LoanCalculator component (src/components/LoanCalculator.js) provides input fields for the user to enter the Principal Loan Amount, Annual Interest Rate, and Loan Term (in months).
 * Upon submitting the form, the calculateEMI function within this component processes the input values.
 * The annual interest rate is converted to a monthly interest rate by dividing it by 12 and then by 100.
 * The EMI is calculated using the formula mentioned above.
 * The calculated EMI, along with the input parameters, is then passed to the AmortizationSchedule component via React Router's useNavigate hook and the state property.
2. Dynamic Amortization Schedule Table with Monthly Breakdown
The application generates a dynamic amortization schedule that breaks down each monthly payment into its principal and interest components, while also showing the remaining loan balance.
Implementation Details:
 * The AmortizationSchedule component (src/components/AmortizationSchedule.js) receives the loan details (principal, interest rate, loan term, and EMI) as state from the LoanCalculator component.
 * The useMemo hook is used to efficiently calculate the amortization schedule whenever the input parameters change.
 * For each month of the loan term, the following calculations are performed:
   * Interest for the month: Remaining Balance * Monthly Interest Rate
   * Principal paid for the month: Monthly EMI - Interest for the month
   * Remaining Balance: Previous Remaining Balance - Principal paid for the month
 * The results for each month are stored in an array of objects, each containing the month number, payment amount, principal paid, interest paid, and the remaining balance.
 * This array is then rendered as a table using Material UI's Table, TableHead, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell, and TableContainer components for a structured and visually appealing presentation.
3. Real-time Currency Conversion of EMI using a Live Exchange Rate API
The application allows users to convert the calculated EMI into over 160 different currencies using a live exchange rate API.
Implementation Details:
 * The CurrencyConverter component (src/components/CurrencyConverter.js) is responsible for this functionality.
 * It utilizes a third-party library or a direct API call (e.g., using axios) to fetch real-time exchange rates.
 * The component will likely have:
   * A dropdown or a selection mechanism for the user to choose the target currency.
   * A display area showing the calculated EMI (passed from the LoanCalculator or a stored value).
   * A display area showing the converted EMI amount in the selected currency.
 * The application will need to handle API requests, manage API keys (if required), and potentially implement caching to reduce the number of API calls.
 * Error handling will be implemented to gracefully manage API failures or invalid responses.
4. Paginated Exchange Rate Table for 160+ Currencies
To provide users with a comprehensive view of available currencies and their exchange rates (relative to a base currency, likely USD or INR), the application includes a paginated table.
Implementation Details:
 * The CurrencyConverter component (or a separate ExchangeRateTable component) will fetch exchange rate data for a wide range of currencies from a reliable API.
 * Material UI's Table, TableHead, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell, and TableContainer will be used to display the currency codes, names, and their corresponding exchange rates.
 * Pagination will be implemented using Material UI's TablePagination component to handle the large number of currencies efficiently. This will allow users to navigate through the list of currencies in manageable chunks.
 * Users might have the option to sort the table by currency code or exchange rate.
 * A loading state will be displayed while fetching the exchange rate data.
5. Dark/Light Mode Toggle for a Customizable Experience
The application provides a toggle to switch between a dark and a light theme, enhancing user comfort and accessibility.
Implementation Details:
 * A custom React Hook, useTheme (src/hooks/useTheme.js), will manage the application's theme state.
 * This hook will:
   * Store the current theme (e.g., 'light' or 'dark') in the component's state.
   * Provide a toggleTheme function to switch between the themes.
   * Persist the user's theme preference in localStorage so that it persists across sessions.
 * Styled Components (styled-components library) and Material UI's ThemeProvider will be used to apply the theme styles.
 * A ThemeToggle component (src/components/ThemeToggle.js) will render a button or switch that, when clicked, calls the toggleTheme function from the useTheme hook.
 * The application's visual elements (backgrounds, text colors, borders, etc.) will be styled based on the current theme.
6. Collapsible Header Navigation on Mobile Screens
To optimize the user interface on smaller mobile screens, the header navigation will collapse into a menu that can be toggled open or closed.
Implementation Details:
 * The Navigation component (src/components/Navigation.js) will handle the header and navigation links.
 * A media query (using CSS or JavaScript) will detect when the screen width is below a certain threshold (e.g., 768px).
 * On mobile screens:
   * The navigation links will be hidden by default.
   * A "hamburger" icon or a similar control will be displayed.
   * Clicking this icon will toggle the visibility of the navigation links, likely using state to control a CSS class or inline styles.
 * Material UI's AppBar, Toolbar, IconButton, and Menu components can be utilized to create a responsive and accessible navigation structure.
7. Fully Responsive UI Built with Material UI
The entire application will be built using Material UI components and responsive design principles to ensure a seamless experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
Implementation Details:
 * Material UI's Grid system (Grid component) will be extensively used for layout management, allowing components to adapt to different screen sizes.
 * Responsive breakpoints provided by Material UI (e.g., xs, sm, md, lg, xl) will be leveraged to adjust the layout and styling of components based on the screen width.
 * CSS media queries will be used in conjunction with Material UI's styling capabilities to fine-tune the responsiveness.
 * Components will be designed to be fluid and adapt their size and arrangement dynamically.
 * Testing on different screen sizes and devices will be conducted to ensure optimal responsiveness.
